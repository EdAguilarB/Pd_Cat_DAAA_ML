# Pd_Cat_DAAA_ML


## Overview
HCat-GNet (Homogeneous Catalyst Graph Neural Network) is a cutting-edge, open-source platform designed to facilitate the virtual evaluation and optimization of homogeneous catalysts. Utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), HCat-GNet predicts the selectivity of homogeneous catalytic reactions based solely on SMILES representations of participant molecules, significantly speeding up the process of ligand optimization in asymmetric catalysis.


## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or 3.9
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
